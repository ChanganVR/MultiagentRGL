# Relational Graph Learning for Multiagent Navigation
This repository contains the codes for our final course project in Fall 2019.


## Installation
1. Install [Python-RVO2](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/Python-RVO2) library
2. Install [socialforce](https://github.com/ChanganVR/socialforce) library
2. Install crowd_sim and crowd_nav into pip
```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
This repository are organized in two parts: crowd_sim/ folder contains the simulation environment and
crowd_nav/ folder contains codes for training and testing the policies. Details of the simulation framework can be found
[here](crowd_sim/README.md). Below are the instructions for training and testing policies, and they should be executed
inside the crowd_nav/ folder. Note that all the configurations are written in the config file, which is taken by the
script as a command line argument.


1. Train a policy.
```
python train.py --policy rgl --config configs/icra_benchmark/rgl_ppo.py --output_dir data/output
```
2. Test policies with 500 test cases.
```
python test.py --policy rgl --model_dir data/output --phase test
```
3. Run policy for one episode and visualize the result.
```
python test.py --policy rgl --model_dir data/output --phase test --visualize --test_case 0
```
4. Plot training curve
```
python utils/plot.py data/output/output.log
```
